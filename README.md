## Building instructions

Tested on Windows and Linux. WorldRender requires OpenGL 4.0+ compatible graphic cards, its dependencies are [GLFW3](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew). There is both a MAKEFILE and a CodeBlocks project for compiling.

## Description
WorldRender is a procedural planet generation and rendering framework, it uses a novel quadtree implementation which uses node hashing to easily information retrieval and collision detection to avoid vertex redundancy. It features both CPU quadtree LOD terrain and CLOD terrain, which can be switched through parameters in the source code.

The framework also uses generic GPU computation to calculate noise value for all vertex position by using Transform Feedback, terrain is generated by using a multifractal noise function by [Inigo Quilez](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/morenoise/morenoise.htm) through Value Noise Derivatives. A View-Dependent Refinement is achieved through Tessellation Shader based on the position of the observer.
